Build: 
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ ./run

Edit the RTS flag "-N" in ./run to match your number of CPUs - 1, as we need
one core dedicated to pulseaudio. So: 

-N1 for dual core
-N3 for quad core


===============================================================================

Drool has the following platform dependencies. 
On Debian / Ubuntu platforms, install them via apt-get install <package-name>: 

- libgtk-dev
- libglib2.0-dev
- libglade2-dev
- fftw3-dev 
- libpulse-dev
- FTGL

Drool depends on the following hackage modules. 
Install them via cabal install <package-name>: 

- mtl
- array
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- FTGL
- glade
- gtk
- gtkglext
- gtk2hs-cast-glade
- pulse-simple
- mtl
- hmatrix
- fft

You might need to patch the drool.cabal configuration file a bit. 
Drool has been successfully built with ghc-7.2 on Windows (without PulseAudio 
and FFT) and ghc-7.4 on Ubuntu. It should work with any version of ghc6, though. 

!!! Note that the Haskell Gtk bindings (gtk2hs) lead to segmentation faults when 
!!! built with ghc-7.2 on Linux - it's not my fault, the gtk2hs maintainers are 
!!! working on it.
