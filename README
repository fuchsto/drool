Drool has the following platform dependencies. 
On Debian / Ubuntu platforms, install them via apt-get install <package-name>: 

- libgtk-dev
- libglib2.0-dev
- libglade2-dev
- fftw3-dev on POSIX systems
- fft-pure on WIN32 systems
- libpulse-dev

Drool depends on the following hackage modules. 
Install them via cabal install <package-name>: 

- mtl
- array
- GLUT
- OpenGL
- glade
- gtk
- gtkglext
- gtk2hs-cast-glade
- pulse-simple
- fft

You might need to patch the drool.cabal configuration file a bit. 
Drool has been successfully built with ghc-7.2 on Windows (without PulseAudio 
and FFT) and ghc-7.4 on Ubuntu. It should work with any version of ghc6, though. 

!!! Note that the Haskell Gtk bindings (gtk2hs) lead to segmentation faults when 
!!! built with ghc-7.2 on Linux - it's not my fault, the gtk2hs maintainers are 
!!! working on it.
